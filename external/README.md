# External Reference

Snapshots of external projects live in this folder.  The `open-webui` subdirectory
contains a read-only copy of the upstream [Open WebUI](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui)
repository.  A scheduled workflow updates the snapshot automatically so tools and
pipes can depend on the real codebase during development.

Browse `external/open-webui/` if you need to inspect how Open WebUI works, but do
not modify anything inside that path.
