# Pipes

Each pipe now lives inside its own folder. The folder name matches the pipe title and contains:

- `README.md` – short description and usage notes for the pipe
- `<pipe_file>.py` – the actual implementation

Copy the Python file into Open WebUI to install. Use the README for valve explanations and configuration tips.
